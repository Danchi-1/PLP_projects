2. Simple Quiz Game 🎮
Create a multiple-choice quiz with questions about Python, movies, or any fun topic! Display scores at the end and allow the user to play again. 🏆
3. Random Joke Generator 🤣
Build a program that stores a list of jokes and randomly selects one to display every time the user runs it. Add a fun twist with jokes about Python or programming! 🐍💡
Tasks:

1. Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.
2. Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.

4. Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.
